Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.\\n   \\n2. **Mix Ingredients:** In a larger bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center, then add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil. \\n\\n3. **Knead the Dough:** Mix together until the dough starts to come together. Transfer it to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.\\n\\n4. **First Rise:** Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Preheat the Oven\\n- Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you're using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.\\n\\n#### Step 3: Shape the Pizza\\n1. **Punch Down the Dough:** Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. \\n\\n2. **Shape the Dough:** Turn it out onto a floured surface and roll it out to your desired thickness (about 12 inches for a standard pizza). You can use your hands to stretch it if you prefer a rustic look.\\n\\n3. **Transfer to a Baking Sheet or Stone:** If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the rolled-out dough onto a pizza peel sprinkled with flour. If using a baking sheet, lightly oil the sheet and transfer the dough onto it.\\n\\n#### Step 4: Add Toppings\\n1. **Spread Sauce:** Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the base, leaving a small edge for the crust.\\n\\n2. **Add Cheese:** Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.\\n\\n3. **Add Additional Toppings:** Add your choice of toppings evenly over the pizza.\\n\\n4. **Season:** Sprinkle with dried oregano and red pepper flakes if desired.\\n\\n#### Step 5: Bake the Pizza\\n- Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.\\n\\n#### Step 6: Enjoy\\n- Remove the pizza from the oven and allow it to cool for a couple of minutes. Slice it up and serve hot!\\n\\n### Tips\\n- Experiment with different sauces (pesto, white sauce) and cheeses (parmesan, goat cheese) for variety.\\n- If you love a crispy crust, consider using a pizza stone.\\n- Feel free to customize the toppings based on your preferences!\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade pizza! 🍕\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, annotations=[]))], created=1744875033, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_0392822090', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=738, prompt_tokens=14, total_tokens=752, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))\n"
